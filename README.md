# Maze Solver: Rat in a Maze Problem

## Overview

This project implements a maze solver based on the classic "Rat in a Maze" problem. The objective is to find a path for a rat from the starting point to the destination while navigating through obstacles in a maze. The maze is represented as a 2D grid where:
- `0` represents a cell that can be traversed.
- `1` represents an obstacle.

## Features

- **Stack-based solution**: The pathfinding is implemented using a custom stack data structure instead of recursion.
- Visualizes the path taken by the rat.
- User-defined maze dimensions and obstacles.
- Input validation to ensure proper maze structure.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Any code editor (e.g., VSCode, PyCharm)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sitendernarwal/maze-solver.git
